<h3>Training Day</h3>
<P>This is one of my all time favourite, as Denzil is on top form and it was a oscar performance</P>

<h3>Bad Boys</h3>
<p>Just love this movie, as it's funny and all out action</p>

<h3>Django</h3>
<p>Great movie on slavery and how it was being black and things they had to fight for to get any form of freedom</p>
